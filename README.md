# Word to PDF

Convert a Word document (DOCX) to a PDF file via the Word to PDF Chrome extension.

## Development

Refer to the respective README files in the [`frontend`](./frontend) and [`backend`](./backend) directories.

The implementation is quite basic with a significant amount of AI-generated code (although manually refined). The aim is to provide a simple solution as soon as possible while keeping it somewhat organized and improving it over time if there is demand.
